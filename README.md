2. Install Netbeans from here. The most basic version will work.

3. Install git for your operating system. You don't need to install anything from GitHub.

4. Clone the repository to your computer.
5. Copy lasabuild.xml to C:/users/YOUR USERNAME/wpilib/java/current/ant/

We will be using Netbeans to program the robot, but the official support is for eclipse. You should have eclipse on your computer just in case.
